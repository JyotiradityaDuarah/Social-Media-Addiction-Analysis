🎯 Objective

To analyze student social media usage and uncover insights that support mental wellness, digital detox recommendations, and awareness programs.

🛠 Tools & Libraries

Python
Pandas, NumPy,
Matplotlib, Seaborn
SciPy
Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Workflow

1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
Loaded the dataset
Identified and handled missing values
Converted data types where needed

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed relationships among:
Age, Gender, Daily Usage (hours)
Sleep duration
Academic Performance
Social Interaction

3. Aggregation & Insights
Used groupby to compute average addiction levels across:
Gender groups
Age groups
Education levels

4. Custom Functions

Implemented:
A function to classify Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
A function that suggests Digital Detox Strategies using conditionals

5. Visualization

Created at least four charts:
Bar Chart
Pie Chart
Heatmap
Line/Distribution Plot
Each visualization includes:
Title
Labeled axes
A short insight


6. Storytelling Summary

Crafted a 10-line narrative covering:
Key patterns
Root causes
Recommended actions to reduce social media addiction


📈 Key Insights (Sample Summary)

Daily usage hours showed strong correlation with sleep disruption.
Higher addiction levels were observed among younger students.
Gender differences in usage patterns were visible but not extreme.
Academic performance declined slightly as screen time increased.
Students with fewer offline interactions showed higher risk levels.

🎯 Outcome

This project demonstrates practical experience in:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Statistical and exploratory analysis
Visualization for behavioral data

Creating custom logic using functions

Data storytelling and insight communication
